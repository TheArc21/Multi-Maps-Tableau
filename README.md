# Multi-Maps-Tableau
The objective of this project is to find out top 4 natural disasters impacting ExxonMobil refineries. I will create multi maps (also known as Trellis charts or Panel charts). The dataset used contains list of natural disasters (Flood, Hurricane etc.) that occurred in the USA between the years of 2004 to 2015(data source FEMA).
