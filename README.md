# Multi-Maps-Tableau | Natural Disasters Impacting Refineries
Through this project, I aim to provide a comprehensive visual analysis of the impact of natural disasters on oil refinery operations across the United States. By leveraging data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and refinery locations from energy companies, I have created interactive visualizations using Tableau. These visualizations enable me to effectively communicate the complex relationships between natural disasters and refinery vulnerabilities, supporting data-driven decision-making for energy stakeholders.

# Key Objectives

1.	Visualize Natural Disaster Occurrences: I map the locations and types of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and fires, across the United States between 2004 and 2015, using FEMA data.
2.	Identify Refinery Locations: I pinpoint the locations of oil refineries, including their associated counties and states, based on refinery data from energy companies.
3.	Analyze Disaster Impact: My analysis uncovers the top four natural disasters posing the greatest threat to refinery operations, enabling proactive planning and mitigation strategies.
4.	Create a Compelling Narrative: I employ rhetorical techniques (emotional, logical, or ethical) to weave the visualizations into a cohesive story, communicating the significance of the findings and potential consequences for critical energy infrastructure.

# Data Sources

For this project, I utilize the following data sources:

1.	Natural Disaster Data: An Excel file containing detailed information on natural disasters, including incident types, locations (counties/areas), and associated states, provided by FEMA.
2.	Refinery Data: An Excel file listing the rankings of energy companies and their refinery locations, including refinery names, counties, and states.
